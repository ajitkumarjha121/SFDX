Community user login flow:
OAuth Connected Apps: Digital Attacker Front end Via CIAM Prod which shows configured for working users, that is because app is configured in connections such a way, whenever user login or reset password first time, OAuth Connected Apps is configured automatically.
Password reset is done by CIAM. Salesforce doesn't trigger any password reset for new users. 
So its not a blocker for the user to login.

Smoke test:
BCR File: XML file which contains complete details about customers like First Name, Last Name, DOB, Email, Address Location, Type of product(Gas or Electricty)
Verivox one

Customer creation Flow:
    File is manually placed to SFTP server(using Postman).
    Mulesoft System picks the file from SFTP Server and Process it.
    Once file is processed, BCR file gets created in Salesforce.  
    Then customer is created from CIAM
    finally successfully BCR created with correct customer details , 
    And customer contract also created with all corresspondence letter.
