Public Groups and Queue
Public Group:
If you want to share some information in your organization among some users, so we make public Group.Public Group is the group of some selected users,then we can share information or we assign some work to group.

Queues:
In our daily life we can take example of Call Centre to understand Queues.There are many Customer Care Executive in a call centre and many customers call at a time and one executive can talk to one customer at one time,so other customer's calls are kept in queues.Same thing is there in salesforce like:
Each user should assigned to at least one lead and same number of leads.
That means user need to handle assigned lead individually and all users in organization should assigned with same number of leads, in this case we can define users in organization as Queue and assign them one by one and in same number using round robin lead assignment.
