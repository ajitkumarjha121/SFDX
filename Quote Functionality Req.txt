However whenever a User tries to Generate a PDF Quote, this program must ensure
1.	Is there an Active Price Book on Opportunity? (check for Pricebook2.inactive = true for Opportunity.PricebookID)

2.	If not that is if an inactive Price Book exists then check for active price book, (Checking for active Price book depends 
	on Account Name, Dealer Price book region, from Pricebook automation object, then select Price book with the Pricebook ID in 
	the record)
	
3.	Refresh price book to current and active price book

4.	Show warning if price book refresh takes place 

5.	If User clicks on OK then generate PDF with refreshed Price book values

6.	If User clicks on Cancel then do not generate PDF
